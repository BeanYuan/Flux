# Flux: Journey Through Time

Embark on a unique platformer adventure with Flux, a game that takes you on a thrilling journey through time. With our core mechanics, we explore the theme of proximity in space but distance in time, immersing you in a gameplay experience unlike any other.

Built with Unity, Flux leverages a combination of hand-crafted assets and open-source tools. The captivating character animations, detailed sprite textures, and atmospheric scene changes are all designed to enrich your experience of time travel within the game.

## Theme:

**Theme-Driven Mechanics:** Flux employs two main mechanics to embody our theme - time travel and rewinding. Players can voyage back in time to spaces that exist differently from the present, or simply rewind to a moment ago.

## Select Requirement:

**Data-Driven Progression:** Our game uses a data class, TimeFrame, which records the state of all sprites each tick, thereby facilitating the rewind mechanic. This system creates a seamless, data-driven progression through the game.

**Advanced Visual Assets:** Flux boasts a consistent and engaging art style, from the tile maps and decorations within the game world to the menus and interfaces. Every visual element has been carefully curated to enhance your gaming experience.

**Procedural Audio:** Our audio design complements our gameplay. Unique sounds accompany key game events - the landing of the character, the pickup of keys, the opening of doors - and a dynamic background score sets the mood. With our audio, we bring Flux's world to life.
